 * 
 * STATEMENT
 * =========
 * The goal of this puzzle is to safely land the spaceship on the platform. It's a simple 
 * introduction to the « Mars Lander - Episode 2 ». Some data is useless and solving this problem 
 * only requires a simple condition.
 * 
 * STORY
 * -----
 * You have been promoted to commander of the Mars Lander mission ! The goal of the operation is 
 * to land an exploration rover on martian ground. Your superiors at NASA expect very much of you 
 * for this mission, and you'll have to prove that you have what it takes to become a great 
 * intersideral commander. You will have to land the space ship on mars, making sure that the 
 * landing is done smoothly.
 * 
 * This easy puzzle is the first in a series of three exercises proposed during the “Mars Lander” 
 * past contest. Once solved feel free to try and master the second puzzle
 * « Mars Lander - Episode 2 » on the same topic but with an increased difficulty!

/*
 * 
 * The Goal
 * ========
 * The goal for your program is to safely land the "Mars Lander" shuttle, the landing ship which 
 * contains the Opportunity rover. Mars Lander is guided by a program, and right now the failure 
 * rate for landing on the NASA simulator is unacceptable.
 * 
 * Note that it may look like a difficult problem, but in reality the problem is easy to solve. 
 * This puzzle is the first level among three, therefore, we need to present you some controls 
 * you won't need in order to complete this first level.
 * 
 * Rules
 * -----
 * Built as a game, the simulator puts Mars Lander on a limited zone of Mars sky.
 * 
 *    The zone is 7000m wide and 3000m high.
 * 
 * For this level, Mars Lander is above the landing zone, in vertical position, with no initial 
 * speed.
 * 
 * There is a unique area of flat ground on the surface of Mars, which is at least 1000 meters 
 * wide.Every second, depending on the current flight parameters (location, speed, fuel ...), 
 * the program must provide the new desired tilt angle and thrust power of Mars Lander:
 *     Angle goes from -90° to 90° . Thrust power goes from 0 to 4 .
 * 
 * For this level, you only need to control the thrust power: the tilt angle should be 0.The 
 * game simulates a free fall without atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is 3.711 m/s² . For a thrust 
 * power of X, a push force equivalent to X m/s² is generated and X liters of fuel are consumed. 
 * As such, a thrust power of 4 in an almost vertical position is needed to compensate for the 
 * gravity on Mars.
 * 
 * For a landing to be successful, the ship must:
 *  - land on flat ground
 *  - land in a vertical position (tilt angle = 0°)
 *  - vertical speed must be limited ( ≤ 40m/s in absolute value)
 *  - horizontal speed must be limited ( ≤ 20m/s in absolute value)
 *  
 * Remember that this puzzle was simplified:
 *  - the landing zone is just below the shuttle. You can therefore ignore rotation and always 
 *    output 0 as the target angle.
 *  - you don't need to store the coordinates of the surface of Mars to succeed.
 *  - you only need your vertical landing speed to be between 0 and 40m/s – your horizontal speed 
 *    being nil.
 *  - As the shuttle falls, the vertical speed is negative. As the shuttle flies upward, the 
 *    vertical speed is positive.
 * 
 * Note
 * ----
 * For this first level, Mars Lander will go through a single test.
 * 
 * Tests and validators are only slightly different. A program that passes a given test will 
 * pass the corresponding validator without any problem.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Game Input
 * ----------
 * The program must first read the initialization data from standard input. Then, within an 
 * infinite loop, the program must read the data from the standard input related to Mars 
 * Lander's current state and provide to the standard output the instructions to move Mars Lander.
 * 
 * Initialization input
 * --------------------
 * Line 1: the number surfaceN of points used to draw the surface of Mars.
 * 
 * Next surfaceN lines: a couple of integers landX landY providing the coordinates of a ground 
 * point. By linking all the points together in a sequential fashion, you form the surface of 
 * Mars which is composed of several segments. For the first point, landX = 0 and for the last 
 * point, landX = 6999
 * 
 * Input for one game turn
 * ------------------------
 * A single line with 7 integers: X Y hSpeed vSpeed fuel rotate power
 *  - X,Y are the coordinates of Mars Lander (in meters).
 *  - hSpeed and vSpeed are the horizontal and vertical speed of Mars Lander (in m/s). These can be 
 *    negative depending on the direction of Mars Lander.
 *  - fuel is the remaining quantity of fuel in liters. When there is no more fuel, the power of 
 *    thrusters falls to zero.
 *  - rotate is the angle of rotation of Mars Lander expressed in degrees.
 *  - power is the thrust power of the landing ship.
 * 
 * Output for one game turn
 * -------------------------
 * A single line with 2 integers: rotate power :
 *  - rotate is the desired rotation angle for Mars Lander. Please note that for each turn the 
 *    actual value of the angle is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 15°.
 *  - power is the desired thrust power. 0 = off. 4 = maximum power. Please note that for each turn 
 *    the value of the actual power is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 1.
 * 
 * Constraints
 * -----------
 * 2 ≤ surfaceN < 30
 * 0 ≤ X < 7000
 * 0 ≤ Y < 3000
 * -500 < hSpeed, vSpeed < 500
 * 0 ≤ fuel ≤ 2000
 * -90 ≤ rotate ≤ 90
 * 0 ≤ power ≤ 4
 * Response time per turn ≤ 100ms
 *

 * Mars Lander - LEVEL 1 - FIRST CONTACT
 * =====================================
 * Cape Canaveral, June 21st 2003, 2 a.m. in the morning. Loud voices echo through the deserted 
 * corridors of the Kennedy Space Center.
 * 
 * “For god's sake Mike! Take off is in less than a month and we still don't have a reliable 
 * solution! ”
 * 
 * Square jaws and a military haircut, Jeff is the manager of the Mars Opportunity mission and 
 * right now he's giving his chief engineer a hell of a time.
 * 
 * “ But simulations show a success rate of 99%. ”
 * “ So what? 1%, that's huge! Would you bet the success of the mission on that? And keep in 
 * mind, if Opportunity crashes, you and I, we'll both be done for. ”
 * “ The top NASA engineers have already worked on this project. It's the best we can achieve! ”
 * “ Then, let's try with external resources and see if anything better comes out of it. ”
